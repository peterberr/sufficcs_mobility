# sufficcs_mobility
This repository contains code developed for an analysis of urban form and mobility characteristics in EU cities, part of the [SUFFICCS](https://peterberr.github.io/sufficcs/) project.

Results of the analysis can be found in an upcoming publication ([)url/doi forthcoming).

The `code` folder contains scripts developed to combine urban mobility surveys with urban form features in each city, and to create some summmary figures and tables of the data. The raw survey data is in most cases not publicly available, and must be applied for to the relevant bodies (see details in scripts and in publication).

The `dictionaries` folder contains dictionaries created to transfer the mobility survey variables into harmonised human-readable variable names., and also to map high-resolution spatial units to mixed-resolution spatial units in French cities and Madrid.

The `feature_engineering` folder contains scripts used for feature engineering of various urban form features used in the analysis. 

The `models` folder contains scripts developed to run models of trip distances, car ownership, and mode choice, and to create summary figures and tables of model results. 

The `outputs` folder contains generated urban form features, and model results and figures.
